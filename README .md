Additional analyses will include          customer segmentation and predictive modeling to forecast future sales trends.

### Expected Outcomes
  A comprehensive dashboard visualizing sales performance by region, product, and timeframe.

  Sales trend predictions to support strategic decision-making.
  A detailed report summarizing insights for leaders to enhance understanding and facilitate informed decision-making.
  
### Problem Statement
  Electronics retailers often struggle to effectively analyze large volumes of sales data, which can hinder their ability to identify trends and optimize       operations. This project addresses these challenges by analyzing sales data to reveal insights that will improve inventory management, refine marketing       strategies, and enable precise customer targeting.
